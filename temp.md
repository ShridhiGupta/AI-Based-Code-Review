❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or passed as
arguments.
* ❌ There are not any parameters being passed into the `sum` function.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, allowing it to correctly calculate their sum.
* ✔️ The function now returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
